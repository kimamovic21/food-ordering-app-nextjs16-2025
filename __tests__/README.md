## Structure Rules

- Keep test files close to business domain in nested folders.
- Name test files with `*.test.ts`.
- Put reusable input fixtures in the root `mocks/` folder.
- Use `utils/testFactories.ts` for generated fake users, restaurants, and orders.
- Use `utils/mongoMemoryServer.ts` when a test needs an isolated in-memory MongoDB instance.
- Focus on behavior contracts, not implementation details.
- Update this README when new unit-test domains, helper utilities, or focused test commands are added.
- Keep this file aligned with `TESTING.md` and `e2e/README.md` when the test strategy changes.

## Running Tests

- Run all tests: `npm run test`
- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- Run a single test file: `npm run test:file -- __tests__/api/register.route.test.ts`
- Run profile unit tests: `npm run test:profile`
- Run payment/webhook-focused unit tests: `npm run test:payment`
- Run realtime/SSE tests: `npm run test:realtime`

## E2E Tests

- End-to-end style tests are kept in `e2e/`.
- See `e2e/README.md` for e2e commands and behavior.

## Environment

- Tests use `MONGODB_URL_TESTS` when available.
- If missing, setup falls back to the local default test DB URL.
