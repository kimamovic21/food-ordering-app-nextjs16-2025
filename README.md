# Fullstack Food Ordering App (Next.js)

Production: [https://foacwd.vercel.app/](https://foacwd.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This is a full-stack food ordering platform built with Next.js App Router and TypeScript.

It includes:

- customer authentication, profile management, saved delivery addresses, cart, checkout, active order quick access, and order history
- restaurant browsing with search/filter/sort/pagination and shareable URLs
- favorites for meals and restaurants
- restaurant ordering-status checks before add-to-cart plus availability alerts when checkout is blocked by closed, paused, closing-soon, or busy restaurants
- loyalty rewards with delivery fee discounts and loyalty history
- ratings and review flows
- approved in-app messaging between customers, restaurant owners, admins, and couriers
- notifications center with unread counts, mark-as-read actions, and role-aware routing
- SSE-backed live refresh for notifications, order status screens, courier assignment, and admin order queues with polling kept as fallback
- TanStack Query caching for shared profile data, favorites, sound settings, and global message/notification unread state
- TanStack Table-powered searchable, sortable, paginated data tables for high-traffic admin and order lists
- Vercel Web Analytics for production traffic insights and Vercel Speed Insights for Web Vitals/performance monitoring
- admin dashboard for users, menu items, categories, restaurants, operations overview, restaurant reports, couriers, orders, support tickets, and statistics
- admin system health dashboard for checking production-critical integrations and missing environment variables without exposing secret values
- courier dashboard with active delivery, delivery history, earnings, courier ratings, and assignment reliability views
- courier workflow with assignment, response-time tracking, availability toggle, live location sharing on maps, delivery PIN handoff, failed-delivery review, and delivery history
- order timeline with visual phase icons, readable activity history, preparation/delivery estimates, delay warnings, ETA-style notifications, delivery confirmation, reorder, and report-problem support tickets
- order safety automation for stale unpaid orders, unanswered courier assignments, ready orders that cannot get a courier, and expired Stripe Checkout sessions
- restaurant busy checkout protection based on each restaurant's active kitchen order limit
- courier-safe cart quantity protection with restaurant-level max items per order and per-menu-item quantity limits
- shared cart and checkout validation so cart warnings and final Stripe checkout use the same server-side menu, restaurant, radius, minimum-order, and quantity rules
- Stripe checkout/webhook flow
- Cloudinary media uploads
- email purchase receipts with Resend + React Email
- AI-assisted menu item descriptions for admin create/edit flows
- Upstash Redis-backed rate limiting for sensitive auth, profile password, checkout, support, and AI endpoints
- Upstash QStash delayed background jobs for order maintenance checks
- Sentry error monitoring, tracing, and production-only error-sampled privacy-masked Session Replay

## Project Documentation

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md): technical architecture, diagrams, data model map, and major workflow diagrams.
- [DESCRIPTION.md](./DESCRIPTION.md): role-by-role feature description and business logic overview.
- [PROJECT_PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md](./PROJECT_PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md): detailed presentation guide covering product flows, roles, routes, integrations, and edge cases.
- [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md): unit, integration, and e2e testing strategy and commands.

## Documentation Maintenance

When a meaningful feature or integration changes, update the docs in the same branch or pull request.

- Use `README.md` for setup, packages, environment variables, public routes, and high-level capabilities.
- Use `DESCRIPTION.md` for role behavior, business rules, checkout/order/courier/support/messaging flows, and user-facing logic.
- Use `ARCHITECTURE.md` for data model, lifecycle, background job, realtime, integration, and system-flow changes.
- Use `TESTING.md`, `__tests__/README.md`, and `e2e/README.md` when test scope, commands, fixtures, or coverage strategy changes.
- Keep AI guidance aligned in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/project-instructions.md`, `.gemini/project-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`, and `.windsurf/rules/project-conventions.md` when workflow-critical rules change.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the final reminder for validation and docs ownership before merging.
- Avoid adding config folders for AI tools that are not actively used in this project.

## TypeScript Types

Reusable domain, DTO, and API response types live in `types/`, grouped by feature area such as `order.ts`, `operations.ts`, `cart.ts`, `menu.ts`, `restaurant.ts`, `messages.ts`, `notifications.ts`, and `support-ticket.ts`. Keep small one-off component props colocated with the component, but move shared frontend/backend contracts into `types/` and re-export from `types/index.ts` when they are reused across routes, components, contexts, or libs.

### Sentry Monitoring

- Sentry is configured through `instrumentation-client.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`, and `instrumentation.ts`.
- `app/global-error.tsx` captures root App Router render errors.
- `/sentry-example-page` and `/api/sentry-example` are development-only verification helpers.
- Client replay is production-only and error-sampled to protect quota; text and inputs are masked and media is blocked.
- Production source maps require `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` at build time so stack traces point back to original TypeScript/TSX files.

### AI Menu Description Assistant

- Admin menu item create and edit forms include a sparkles action on the description field.
- The action calls `POST /api/ai/menu-item-description` from the server, so the OpenAI key is never exposed to the browser.
- The route uses `gpt-5-mini` and caps generated descriptions at 700 characters.

### Messaging

- Routes: `/messages` is the inbox, and `/messages/[participantId]` opens a specific approved thread.
- Access rules: customers can only chat with their assigned courier or restaurant owner for an order; admins can chat with other admins and couriers; customer-to-customer chat stays blocked.
- Realtime: the implementation uses server-sent events plus polling so unread badges and open threads update quickly without a third-party chat service.
- Security: messages are stored in MongoDB with app-level authorization and transport/session security. End-to-end encryption is intentionally not enabled here because the app needs role-based operational visibility and moderation; if strict E2E is required later, treat it as a separate product decision.

### Realtime Updates

- SSE routes are implemented with browser-native `EventSource`, so no extra npm package or external realtime account is required.
- `/api/messages/stream` pushes message events to the signed-in participant.
- `/api/notifications/stream` pushes notification events only to the signed-in recipient.
- Notifications remain stored in MongoDB as the source of truth; SSE only tells the UI to refresh sooner.
- Global message and notification badges use TanStack Query through `components/shared/TanStackQueryProvider.tsx` and shared keys in `libs/queryKeys.ts`.
- SSE events invalidate the relevant TanStack Query keys, then the existing JSON endpoints return the authoritative data.
- Polling remains in place as a fallback for notifications, messages, order details, courier delivery, and admin order views if an SSE connection drops or a serverless instance cannot share in-memory events.
- Order status, courier assignment, paid-order, canceled-order, late-order, support-ticket, and restaurant-availability notifications can trigger instant UI refreshes on relevant screens.

### TanStack Query

- `components/shared/TanStackQueryProvider.tsx` creates the client-side `QueryClient` used by app-level providers.
- `libs/queryKeys.ts` stores shared query keys so cache invalidation stays consistent.
- Shared profile data, favorite IDs/lists, notification/message sound settings, message inbox/thread views, and global messages/notifications use TanStack Query for server-state caching, background refetch, optimistic updates, and SSE-driven invalidation where applicable.
- Favorite toggle buttons update `queryKeys.favorites` optimistically, then invalidate the same favorite group so menu cards, restaurant cards, and favorite pages stay in sync.
- Existing route handlers remain the source of truth. TanStack Query should not replace API authorization, MongoDB validation, checkout validation, or webhook idempotency.
- Prefer TanStack Query for future client screens with server data that needs loading state, refetching, cache invalidation, polling, or window-focus refresh.

### TanStack Table

- `components/shared/TanStackDataTable.tsx` provides the shared headless table wrapper for searchable, sortable, paginated UI tables.
- `components/shared/OrderItemsDataTable.tsx` provides the simple TanStack-powered order item table used inside order detail cards.
- Current rollout uses TanStack Table on `/admin-dashboard/orders`, `/admin-dashboard/users`, `/admin-dashboard/menu-items`, `/admin-dashboard/audit-logs`, `/my-orders`, `/admin-dashboard/orders/[id]`, and `/my-orders/[id]`.
- Keep order/payment/reorder/cancel handlers in the owning screen component; use the table wrapper only for presentation, filtering, sorting, pagination, and column visibility.
- Prefer TanStack Table for larger admin/customer lists. For small detail tables, use the simple mode without toolbar or pagination when a clean read-only table is better.

### Frontend Utility Packages

- `nuqs` is mounted through `NuqsAdapter` in `app/layout.tsx` and is used for URL-backed search, filters, sorting, period filters, selected ticket links, and pagination on menu, restaurant, reports, orders, users, and support views.
- `cmdk` powers the global app command palette in `components/shared/AppCommandPalette.tsx`. Open it from the header search button or with `Ctrl/Cmd + K`.
- `react-error-boundary` powers `components/shared/AppErrorBoundary.tsx`, which wraps the main app shell and reports caught client render errors to Sentry.
- `sharp` is installed so Next.js image optimization has the recommended production image processor available. It is used automatically by Next.js and should not be imported directly in app components.
- `@vercel/analytics` is mounted in `app/layout.tsx` with `<Analytics />`. It does not need a project env var for normal Vercel deployments and complements Sentry by tracking product traffic instead of application errors.
- `@vercel/speed-insights` is mounted in `app/layout.tsx` with `<SpeedInsights />`. It does not need a project env var on Vercel and complements Analytics/Sentry by measuring real user Web Vitals and route performance.
- `currency.js` is wrapped by `libs/money.ts` for checkout, coupons, courier earnings, delivery fees, and report calculations that should avoid floating-point drift.
- `libphonenumber-js` is wrapped by `libs/phone.ts`; profile and checkout phone values are validated and stored in E.164 format, while local Bosnia and Herzegovina numbers such as `062...` remain accepted.
- `@faker-js/faker` powers reusable test factories in `__tests__/utils/testFactories.ts`.
- `mongodb-memory-server` is available through `__tests__/utils/mongoMemoryServer.ts` for future Mongo integration tests that need a fully isolated in-memory database.

### Order Flow And Restaurant Capacity

- Restaurants can configure average preparation time, average delivery time, and an active kitchen order limit in the admin restaurant form.
- Restaurants can configure `maxItemsPerOrder` up to 20 items, and each menu item can configure `maxQuantityPerOrder` up to 20 units per order.
- Checkout snapshots the restaurant estimates onto each order, so order detail timelines can show expected timing alongside actual phase durations.
- Public menu item pages check the restaurant ordering status before adding to cart, while checkout remains the final server-side source of truth.
- Checkout blocks restaurants that are closed, paused, outside delivery radius, blocked by working hours, or inside the final 60 minutes before closing, and surfaces the next opening time when available.
- Checkout blocks new orders when the restaurant has reached its paid active kitchen order limit (`placed`, `processing`, or `ready` orders).
- Add-to-cart, cart validation, and `/api/checkout` all enforce item quantity limits and total order item limits so oversized courier-unfriendly orders cannot bypass the UI.
- Blocked checkout attempts for active-order, restaurant-availability, capacity, unavailable-item, and quantity-limit reasons are written to audit logs as `checkout.blocked` without exposing secrets.
- `libs/orderCapacityBackfill.ts` provides a server-only helper to dry-run or repair older restaurant/menu item documents that are missing or have out-of-range order capacity fields.
- Checkout deduplicates recent identical unpaid `placed` order attempts by reusing or recovering the existing Stripe Checkout session instead of creating another order.
- Unpaid `placed` orders show the customer a countdown based on the same 30-minute auto-cancel window used by background maintenance.
- When a stale unpaid `placed` order is system-canceled, the app also attempts to expire the still-open Stripe Checkout session so old payment tabs cannot complete canceled orders.
- When a customer manually cancels an unpaid `placed` order, the app also attempts to expire that order's Stripe Checkout session.
- Cart validation shows item-specific unavailable/deleted-item blockers, server-side restaurant preflight blockers, delivery-radius blockers, and non-blocking price-change warnings before Stripe Checkout.
- Cart can suggest the best public coupon for the current restaurant subtotal and let the customer apply it directly.
- Checkout blocks customers from starting another paid active order until the previous order is completed or canceled.
- Signed-in customers see a header quick-access link to finish payment, track the active order, or spot a delayed active order without hunting through order history.
- Customers can save up to five validated delivery addresses with confirmed latitude/longitude and apply them during checkout; duplicate saves reuse the existing saved address instead of creating another entry.
- Order detail pages show a delay warning when active elapsed time passes the saved estimated total plus the grace window.
- Customer and admin order detail pages show an activity log built from stored order timestamps so the important payment, kitchen, courier, delivery, and cancellation events are easy to scan.
- Admin order detail pages include an internal order note for support/kitchen/handoff context; customer and courier order payloads must not expose that note.
- Previous orders can be reordered into the cart only after current menu item existence, availability, restaurant ownership, and prices are rechecked.
- Favorite restaurants and restaurant detail pages can rebuild the latest previous order from that restaurant into the cart.
- Customers can request a notification when a closed, paused, closing-soon, or busy restaurant starts accepting orders again.
- Couriers record delivery handoff with a customer-visible PIN; customers or the restaurant admin then finalize delivery completion.
- If a customer is unavailable after extended transport time, the courier can request failed-delivery cancellation; the restaurant owner or super admin must verify it before the order is canceled and the courier is released.
- Order status notifications use phase-specific copy, including preparation and delivery ETA hints when an estimate is available.
- Customers and couriers can report order or delivery problems; admins manage those reports from `/admin-dashboard/support-tickets`.
- Failed-delivery review notifications route restaurant admins to `/admin-dashboard/orders/[id]`, while customer order notifications stay on customer order pages.
- `/admin-dashboard/operations` gives restaurant admins a live operations overview for active order stages, kitchen capacity, restaurant status, available couriers, today revenue, unpaid/canceled counts, quick actions, and orders that need attention.
- `/admin-dashboard/orders` surfaces late active-order alerts and links to `/admin-dashboard/order-queue` for the full operational view.
- `/admin-dashboard/restaurant-reports` generates daily, weekly, and monthly restaurant performance summaries from order data and can download the same report as a PDF when the selected period has traffic.
- Restaurants, restaurant-owner account deletion, and menu item deletion are blocked while active orders still depend on that data; menu items should be marked unavailable first and deleted after active orders finish.
- Super-admin user deletion is intentionally guarded: block deletion when the target user, courier, or owned restaurant has active orders; delete owned restaurant/menu/coupon/availability data and Cloudinary media; remove authored reviews and courier reviews tied to the deleted courier; anonymize support-ticket reporter details; keep historical orders for reporting/audit snapshots.

### Background Jobs With QStash

- `@upstash/qstash` is used for delayed order-maintenance checks that should run later without relying only on someone opening an order page.
- Checkout schedules a 30-minute unpaid-order check after a Stripe Checkout session is created.
- When that delayed check cancels an unpaid order, the order-maintenance helper tries to expire the open Stripe Checkout session before writing the cancellation audit metadata.
- Assigning a courier schedules a 10-minute courier-assignment timeout check. If the courier does not accept or decline in time, the assignment is marked `expired`, the courier is released, and restaurant admins are notified to choose another courier.
- Courier assignment history records accepted, declined, and expired attempts so admin and courier performance views can show missed assignments, response rate, acceptance rate, and average response time.
- Moving an order to `ready` schedules a 60-minute ready-without-courier check.
- `POST /api/qstash/order-maintenance` receives QStash jobs, verifies the QStash signature, reloads the order from MongoDB, and runs the existing courier-assignment timeout or order auto-cancellation logic.
- QStash publishing is fail-open: if the QStash env vars are missing, the app URL is local, or QStash is temporarily unavailable, checkout and order status updates still continue.
- For production, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or `NEXTAUTH_URL` must point to a public HTTPS app URL so QStash can call the API route. Local `localhost` URLs are intentionally skipped unless you test through a public tunnel.

### Cloudinary Menu Item Maintenance

- Menu item uploads use the `menu-items` folder in development and `menu-items-production` in production.
- `npm run cloudinary:menu-items:audit` compares MongoDB `menu_items.image` public IDs with the selected Cloudinary folder and reports orphan images without deleting anything.
- `npm run cloudinary:menu-items:cleanup` runs the same audit and deletes only Cloudinary images that are in the selected folder but no longer referenced by MongoDB.
- The cleanup script also reports menu item images that are referenced in MongoDB but missing on Cloudinary, which helps catch broken image URLs.
- Dry-run is the default behavior. Use the cleanup command only after reviewing the audit output.
- To inspect production assets locally, run `node scripts/cleanup-menu-item-cloudinary-images.mjs --env=production`; add `--apply` only when you intentionally want to delete production orphans.

## Auth: Email Verification & Password Reset

- Overview: Credentials-based accounts now require email verification when `SKIP_VERIFY_EMAIL` is `false` (recommended for local development). In production you can set `SKIP_VERIFY_EMAIL=true` to skip verification for legacy or migration scenarios.
- Scope: This applies only to `provider: 'credentials'` users. OAuth users (Google) are automatically marked verified and are not subject to verification or password reset flows.
- Env vars used: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SENDER_EMAIL`, optional `RESEND_RECEIVER_EMAIL`, `SKIP_VERIFY_EMAIL`, and optional Upstash Redis variables for rate limiting.
- Endpoints (server):
  - `POST /api/register` — creates a credentials user and (when required) issues a verification token and sends an email.
  - `POST /api/verify-email` — accepts `{ token }` and marks the user verified when token is valid.
  - `POST /api/resend-verification` — issues a new verification token and emails it.
  - `POST /api/forgot-password` — issues a password-reset token for credentials users and emails it.
  - `POST /api/reset-password` — accepts `{ token, newPassword, confirmNewPassword }` to update password when token is valid.
- Public pages (client):
  - `/verify-email` — page to accept token via query and to request resend.
  - `/forgot-password` — form to request password reset email.
  - `/reset-password/[token]` — page to set a new password using the token in the URL.

See `libs/authEmails.tsx` for token generation, hashing, and sending logic (Resend + React Email templates are under `components/resend/`).

## Rate Limiting

- Upstash Redis stores short-lived counters for sensitive endpoints.
- Protected flows include credentials login, register, forgot password, resend verification, profile password changes, checkout, support ticket creation, and AI menu description generation.
- Redis is not the main database. MongoDB remains the source of truth for users, orders, restaurants, messages, and tickets.
- If Upstash env vars are missing or Redis is temporarily unavailable, `libs/rateLimit.ts` fails open so local development and critical app flows do not break.

## Date Handling

- MongoDB stores real `Date` values for timestamps such as `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `completedAt`, and order phase fields.
- API responses should serialize dates as ISO strings instead of preformatted labels.
- UI, receipt email, and PDF receipt date formatting should use `libs/dateFormat.ts`.
- `libs/dateFormat.ts` formats display dates in the app timezone (`Europe/Sarajevo`) through `@date-fns/tz`.
- The main app display format is `dd/MM/yyyy`; date-time displays use `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`.
