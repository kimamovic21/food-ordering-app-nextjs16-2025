# Claude Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI assistance in this repository.

## Project Context

- Framework: Next.js 16 App Router (TypeScript)
- UI: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Radix, cmdk, TanStack Table
- Client data cache: TanStack Query
- Auth: NextAuth with MongoDB adapter
- DB: MongoDB via Mongoose
- Payments: Stripe
- Images: Cloudinary
- Image optimization: sharp for Next.js production image handling
- Maps: Leaflet
- Email: Resend + React Email
- AI: OpenAI SDK for server-side menu description generation
- Rate limiting: Upstash Redis for short-lived counters on sensitive routes
- Background jobs: Upstash QStash for delayed order-maintenance checks, including unanswered courier assignment timeouts
- Courier assignment history tracks accepted, declined, and expired attempts for response-rate and missed-assignment stats.
- Dates: date-fns and @date-fns/tz through `libs/dateFormat.ts` for UI, email, and PDF date formatting in the app timezone
- Money and phone helpers: currency.js through `libs/money.ts`, and libphonenumber-js through `libs/phone.ts`
- Sharing: react-share
- URL state: nuqs for shareable search/filter/sort/pagination state
- Client recovery: react-error-boundary for localized interactive fallbacks
- Analytics: Vercel Web Analytics and Vercel Speed Insights mounted in the root layout
- Messaging: approved app-native threads with realtime unread badges and per-user message visibility
- Order operations: saved delivery addresses, pre-cart restaurant ordering checks, active order quick access, best coupon suggestion, reorder validation, favorite restaurant quick reorder, restaurant accepting-order checks, restaurant availability alerts, operations overview, preparation/delivery estimates, order delay warnings, delivery PIN handoff, ETA-style notifications, customer/admin delivery confirmation, support tickets, and late-order alerts

## Goals for AI Assistance

- Prefer small, incremental changes with clear explanations.
- Before implementing a new feature or non-trivial app logic, create or switch to a dedicated local feature branch from `main` unless the user explicitly asks to work on the current branch.
- Respect existing patterns in app/, libs/, models/, and components/.
- Use TypeScript types and avoid any implicit any.
- Keep reusable domain, DTO, and API response types in `types/`; use lowercase feature filenames and PascalCase exported names. Keep one-off component props colocated with the component.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless requested.
- Keep docs in sync when adding features, integrations, or env vars.

## Coding Guidelines

- Keep server secrets in server-only code (route handlers, libs), including OpenAI keys.
- Validate API inputs and return clear error responses.
- Use existing utility helpers when possible (libs/).
- Store timestamps as MongoDB `Date` values, return ISO/raw date fields from APIs, and format user-facing dates through `libs/dateFormat.ts` (`dd/MM/yyyy`, `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`).
- Use `libs/money.ts` for business money calculations; avoid hand-rolled floating-point arithmetic in checkout, coupons, earnings, and reports.
- Use `libs/phone.ts` before saving phone values; local Bosnia and Herzegovina numbers are accepted and normalized to E.164.
- Saved customer delivery addresses live on `User.deliveryAddresses`, are capped at five, require complete delivery fields plus confirmed latitude/longitude, dedupe duplicate saves by normalized address/phone/coordinates, and should be loaded/mutated through `/api/profile/delivery-addresses`.
- Avoid breaking changes to API response shapes.
- Preserve role-based access checks (admin/courier/user).
- Preserve message access rules: no customer-to-customer chat, and order conversations must match the assigned courier or restaurant owner.
- Preserve checkout accepting-order checks before Stripe session creation: working hours, the 60-minute-before-closing cutoff, pause state, blocked dates, delivery radius, active kitchen capacity, courier delivery readiness, item availability, coupons, and loyalty.
- Public add-to-cart surfaces should prefetch visible restaurant ordering status where possible, check `/api/restaurants/[id]/ordering-status` before changing the cart, and still keep checkout as the server-authoritative source of truth.
- Preserve checkout duplicate protection: recent identical unpaid `placed` attempts use `checkoutFingerprint` and should reuse or recover the existing Stripe Checkout session.
- Cart validation should keep unavailable/deleted/invalid items as hard checkout blockers, while price changes stay non-blocking and should be shown clearly before checkout.
- Active customer order quick access should use `/api/my-orders/active`, apply stale-order maintenance before returning data, and stay customer-only.
- Order delay warnings should use `libs/orderDelay.ts` and compare elapsed active time against the saved estimated total plus the grace window; development time offsets can affect the warning without changing MongoDB timestamps.
- Do not delete restaurants, restaurant-owner accounts, or menu items while active orders still depend on them; use `libs/orderDeletionGuards.ts` and return `409` with clear guidance.
- Super-admin user deletion must use the guarded cascade helper, keep historical orders, block active customer/courier/restaurant orders, clean related Cloudinary media and restaurant/menu/coupon/review/availability/favorite data, and anonymize support-ticket reporter identity rather than deleting ticket history.
- Preserve stale unpaid auto-cancel protection: when the app cancels an unpaid `placed` order, it should try to expire the open Stripe Checkout session and audit the result without blocking cancellation; customer order screens should show the same 30-minute payment-expiry window.
- Preserve customer manual cancel protection: unpaid `placed` order cancellation should use the same Stripe Checkout expiration helper and audit metadata.
- Treat best coupon suggestions as UI help only; checkout must revalidate coupons server-side.
- Reorder flows must rebuild from current `menu_items` data and block deleted, unavailable, cross-restaurant, or invalid items.
- Restaurant reports live at `/admin-dashboard/restaurant-reports` and generate daily, weekly, and monthly summaries/PDFs from order data.
- Restaurant operations overview lives at `/admin-dashboard/operations` and uses `/api/restaurant/operations` for active stage counts, kitchen capacity, restaurant status, courier availability, today revenue, unpaid/canceled counts, quick actions, and urgent order attention items.
- Preserve delivery double confirmation: courier PIN handoff first, then customer or restaurant admin completion.
- Keep support tickets role-scoped between restaurant support and app support.
- Keep ETA-style notifications and late active-order alerts aligned with order timeline state; failed-delivery review notifications should route restaurant admins to `/admin-dashboard/orders/[id]`.
- Keep QStash delayed job handlers server-only, signature-verified, idempotent, and fail-open around user-facing checkout/order status flows.
- Keep SSE realtime updates lightweight: `/api/messages/stream` and `/api/notifications/stream` should only signal relevant signed-in users, while polling fallback and existing JSON endpoints remain the source of truth.
- Use TanStack Query for client-side server state that needs cache, refetch, invalidation, optimistic updates, or polling. Public restaurant discovery/detail/menu views, message inbox/thread views, and favorite ID/list views should stay cached through shared keys in `libs/queryKeys.ts`, and SSE should invalidate cached queries instead of duplicating source-of-truth state.
- Use TanStack Table through `components/shared/TanStackDataTable.tsx` for larger list UIs that need search, sorting, pagination, or column visibility. Use simple mode without toolbar/pagination for small read-only detail tables such as order items. Keep row actions and mutations in the owning screen component.
- `NuqsAdapter` is mounted in `app/layout.tsx`; use `nuqs` for URL-backed filters, sorting, pagination, selected ticket links, periods, and other shareable client state.
- `components/shared/AppCommandPalette.tsx` uses `cmdk`; add important new routes/actions there when adding major navigation surfaces.
- `components/shared/AppErrorBoundary.tsx` uses `react-error-boundary` and reports caught client render errors to Sentry; keep it for client-side recovery, not API validation.
- Keep Sentry Session Replay disabled in development; browser replay should stay production-only and sampled on error sessions to protect quota.
- Preserve Upstash Redis rate limits on credentials login, register, forgot password, resend verification, checkout, support ticket creation, and AI menu description generation.
- Preserve QStash scheduling for unpaid-order, courier-assignment-timeout, and ready-without-courier maintenance checks when changing checkout, courier assignment, or order status logic.
- Keep payment and webhook flows idempotent.
- Keep receipt email generation in server code.

## Testing and Validation

- Test runner: Vitest.
- Tests are stored in `__tests__/`.
- Reusable fixtures are stored in `mocks/`.
- E2E tests are stored in `e2e/` and use `MONGODB_URL_TESTS`.
- Auth starter tests exist for register and credentials login behavior.
- Order-flow coverage includes checkout, coupons, restaurant availability helpers, notification copy, courier delivery summaries, and high-risk lifecycle transitions.
- Use `__tests__/utils/testFactories.ts` for generated fixtures, and `__tests__/utils/mongoMemoryServer.ts` for isolated Mongo integration tests when needed.
- Run npm run lint after changes.
- Run npm run test after test-related changes.
- For API changes, note any new env vars in example.env.
- For feature additions, also update README.md and AGENTS.md.

## Documentation Maintenance

- Treat docs updates as part of done-state for non-trivial feature, integration, route, env, schema/model, background-job, order/courier/auth/payment/email, realtime, observability, or test workflow changes.
- Keep docs scoped: `README.md` for setup/package/env and high-level capabilities, `DESCRIPTION.md` for role behavior and business rules, `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system/data-flow changes, and `TESTING.md`, `__tests__/README.md`, or `e2e/README.md` for test strategy changes.
- Keep AI guidance aligned across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/project-instructions.md`, `.gemini/project-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`, and `.windsurf/rules/project-conventions.md` when workflow-critical rules change.
- For every meaningful code/docs change that will become a commit, add the commit title/name to `documentation.txt` so the project work log stays aligned with the git history.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the final merge checklist for validation and docs ownership.
- Avoid adding new AI-tool config folders unless the tool is actively used in this project.
- In final summaries for meaningful changes, say whether docs were updated or why no docs update was needed.

## AI Config Folder Strategy

- `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical Claude policy file for this repository.
- `.claude/project-instructions.md` is a supplemental, task-oriented checklist.
- `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`, `.windsurf/rules/project-conventions.md`, and `.gemini/project-instructions.md` should stay aligned on security and workflow-critical rules.
- If you update auth, payments, webhook behavior, email flow, env vars, or docs process, keep all root AI docs synchronized.
