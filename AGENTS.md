# AI Agent Guide

This repository is a full-stack food ordering app built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, MongoDB (Mongoose), NextAuth, Stripe, Cloudinary, Leaflet, Upstash Redis, Upstash QStash, and Resend/React Email.

## Project Summary

- Frontend: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Radix, Recharts, TanStack Query, TanStack Table, nuqs, cmdk, and react-error-boundary.
- Backend: Next.js route handlers in app/api with Mongoose models in models/.
- Auth: NextAuth with MongoDB adapter and Google OAuth.
- Payments: Stripe Checkout, payment-link endpoint, and webhook processing.
- Images: Cloudinary uploads for user and menu media.
- Image optimization: `sharp` is installed for Next.js production image optimization.
- Maps: Leaflet and React Leaflet for courier and delivery tracking.
- Email: Resend + React Email (`react-email`, `@react-email/components`, `@react-email/render`) for purchase receipts.
- AI: OpenAI SDK is used server-side for admin menu item description generation.
- Rate limiting: Upstash Redis stores short-lived counters for sensitive auth, checkout, support, and AI routes.
- Background jobs: Upstash QStash schedules delayed order-maintenance checks for stale unpaid orders, unanswered courier assignments, and ready orders that cannot get a courier.
- Sharing: `react-share` is used for social share actions.
- Client data cache: TanStack Query powers shared profile data, favorite IDs/lists, public restaurant discovery/detail/menu views, notification/message sound settings, message inbox/thread views, and global message/notification unread state.
- Data tables: TanStack Table powers shared searchable, sortable, paginated table UI through `components/shared/TanStackDataTable.tsx`.
- Dates: `date-fns` and `@date-fns/tz` are used through `libs/dateFormat.ts` for UI, email, and PDF date formatting in the app timezone.
- Money and phone helpers: `currency.js` is wrapped by `libs/money.ts`, and `libphonenumber-js` is wrapped by `libs/phone.ts`.
- Observability: Sentry monitors browser, server, and edge errors/traces through `instrumentation-client.ts`, `instrumentation.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`, and `app/global-error.tsx`; browser Session Replay is production-only and sampled only on errors; Vercel Web Analytics and Speed Insights are mounted from `@vercel/analytics/next` and `@vercel/speed-insights/next` in `app/layout.tsx`.

## High-Level Features

- Customer flows: auth, profile, saved delivery addresses, menu browsing, cart/checkout, pre-cart restaurant ordering checks, active order quick access, best coupon suggestion, reorder, favorite restaurant quick reorder, restaurant availability alerts, favorites, loyalty history, reviews, approved messaging, visual order tracking, order timelines, order delay warnings, delivery confirmation, and support tickets.
- Admin dashboard: users, categories, menu items, restaurants, operations overview, restaurant reports, orders, order queue, late-order alerts, couriers, support tickets, statistics, and AI-assisted menu descriptions.
- Courier flows: assignment with courier-only notes, availability toggle, live location sharing, delivery PIN handoff, problem reporting, tracked delivery maps, and delivery history metrics.
- Restaurant operations: menu item availability, active-order delete protection, working-hours checkout protection, 60-minute-before-closing checkout cutoff, pause/blocked-date/radius checks, preparation/delivery estimates, and active order limit checks that can temporarily block checkout when the kitchen is busy.

## Code Layout

- app/: Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers
  - app/api/: API routes
  - app/(home)/: marketing/home components
  - app/(auth)/: login/register
  - app/admin-dashboard/: admin pages
  - app/my-delivery and app/my-deliveries/: courier pages
- components/: shared components and UI primitives
- contexts/: React contexts and hooks
- libs/: auth, integrations, business rules, and helper utilities
- models/: Mongoose schemas
- types/: reusable TypeScript domain models, DTOs, and API response contracts shared across frontend, backend, contexts, and libs
- public/: static assets

## Conventions

- Use TypeScript for new code.
- Keep reusable domain, DTO, and API response types in `types/` using lowercase feature filenames and PascalCase exported type names. Small one-off component prop types can stay colocated with their component.
- Keep components small and focused; prefer composition from shared components.
- Before implementing a new feature or non-trivial app logic, create or switch to a dedicated local feature branch from `main` unless the user explicitly asks to work on the current branch. Keep `main` as the stable baseline.
- API route handlers should validate inputs and use models/ for data access.
- Keep secrets in server-side code only (Stripe, Cloudinary, Resend, OpenAI keys).
- Do not hardcode personal addresses, phone numbers, or private receiver emails; use neutral fixtures or env vars such as `RESEND_RECEIVER_EMAIL`.
- Avoid breaking API response shapes unless explicitly requested.
- Store timestamps as MongoDB `Date` values, return ISO/raw date fields from APIs, and format user-facing dates through `libs/dateFormat.ts` (`dd/MM/yyyy`, `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`).
- Use `libs/money.ts` for business money calculations; avoid hand-rolled floating-point arithmetic in checkout, coupons, earnings, and reports.
- Use `libs/phone.ts` before saving customer/admin/courier phone values; local Bosnia and Herzegovina numbers are accepted and normalized to E.164.
- Saved customer delivery addresses live on `User.deliveryAddresses`, are capped at five, require complete delivery fields plus confirmed latitude/longitude, dedupe duplicate saves by normalized address/phone/coordinates, and should be loaded/mutated through `/api/profile/delivery-addresses`.
- Messaging should remain role-restricted: no customer-to-customer chat, and order threads must match the assigned courier or restaurant owner.
- Public add-to-cart surfaces should prefetch visible restaurant ordering status where possible, check `/api/restaurants/[id]/ordering-status` before changing the cart, and still keep checkout as the server-authoritative source of truth.
- Checkout must preserve restaurant accepting-order checks: working hours, the 60-minute-before-closing cutoff, pause state, blocked dates, delivery radius, active kitchen capacity, item availability, coupons, and loyalty must be validated before creating Stripe sessions.
- Checkout should deduplicate recent identical unpaid `placed` attempts using `checkoutFingerprint`; reuse or recover the existing Stripe Checkout session instead of creating duplicate orders.
- Cart validation should keep unavailable/deleted/invalid items as hard checkout blockers, while price changes stay non-blocking and should be shown clearly before checkout.
- Active customer order quick access should use `/api/my-orders/active`, apply stale-order maintenance before returning data, and stay customer-only.
- Order delay warnings should use `libs/orderDelay.ts` and compare elapsed active time against the saved estimated total plus the grace window; development time offsets can affect the warning without changing MongoDB timestamps.
- Do not delete restaurants, restaurant-owner accounts, or menu items while active orders still depend on them; use `libs/orderDeletionGuards.ts` and return `409` with clear guidance.
- Super-admin user deletion must use the guarded cascade helper, keep historical orders, block active customer/courier/restaurant orders, clean related Cloudinary media and restaurant/menu/coupon/review/availability/favorite data, and anonymize support-ticket reporter identity rather than deleting ticket history.
- System auto-cancellation of stale unpaid orders should attempt to expire the open Stripe Checkout session and record the result in audit metadata without blocking local cancellation.
- Customer manual cancellation of unpaid `placed` orders should use the same Stripe Checkout session expiration helper and audit the result.
- Best coupon suggestions are user-facing help only; checkout must revalidate coupons server-side.
- Reorder must rebuild from current `menu_items` data and block deleted, unavailable, cross-restaurant, or invalid items.
- Restaurant quick reorder must use the same current `menu_items` rebuild rules as order reorder.
- Public and superadmin restaurant filters should stay server-authoritative before pagination so status, rating, delivery-radius, and operational filters do not produce incorrect page counts.
- Restaurant report UI lives at `/admin-dashboard/restaurant-reports`; daily, weekly, and monthly reports should show zeros for empty periods and disable PDF download when there is no activity.
- Restaurant operations overview lives at `/admin-dashboard/operations` and uses `/api/restaurant/operations` to summarize active order stages, kitchen capacity, restaurant open/paused/closing status, courier availability, today revenue, unpaid/canceled counts, quick actions, and orders needing attention.
- Delivery completion is double-confirmed: courier records handoff with the delivery PIN, then customer or restaurant admin finalizes completion.
- Courier assignment history should record accepted, declined, and expired attempts so courier reliability stats can calculate response rate, acceptance rate, missed assignments, and average response time.
- Stale unpaid `placed` orders can auto-cancel after 30 minutes and should show customers a payment-expiry countdown; pending courier assignments expire after 10 minutes without a courier response, and `ready` orders without a courier can warn after 15 minutes and auto-cancel after 60 minutes.
- Support tickets should remain role-scoped: restaurant owners handle their restaurant reports, while app-support tickets route to the super admin.
- Order notifications can include ETA-style phase copy, late active-order alerts should point admins toward the order queue, and failed-delivery review notifications should point restaurant admins to `/admin-dashboard/orders/[id]`.
- QStash delayed job routes must stay server-only, verify QStash signatures, and reuse existing idempotent business helpers such as `applyOrderAutoCancellation`. Publishing should fail open so checkout/order status updates do not break if QStash is unavailable.
- Realtime updates use SSE with polling fallback: `/api/messages/stream` and `/api/notifications/stream` push events only to the signed-in participant/recipient, and clients should still refresh existing JSON endpoints as the source of truth.
- TanStack Query should be used for client-side server data that benefits from cache, refetch, invalidation, optimistic updates, or polling. Keep query keys in `libs/queryKeys.ts`; use `queryKeys.favorites` for favorite ID/list invalidation and SSE events to invalidate query keys instead of duplicating source-of-truth state.
- TanStack Table should be used through `components/shared/TanStackDataTable.tsx` for larger list UIs that need search, sorting, pagination, or column visibility. Use simple mode without toolbar/pagination for small read-only detail tables such as order items. Keep page-specific mutations and business actions in the owning component, not in the shared table wrapper.
- `NuqsAdapter` is mounted in `app/layout.tsx`; use `nuqs` for URL-backed client state such as filters, sort, search, selected ticket links, periods, and pagination when shareable URLs matter.
- `components/shared/AppCommandPalette.tsx` uses `cmdk`; add new important routes/actions there when adding major navigation surfaces.
- `components/shared/AppErrorBoundary.tsx` uses `react-error-boundary` and reports caught client render errors to Sentry; keep it as client recovery, not API validation.
- Keep Sentry instrumentation files intact. Sentry DSNs are allowed in browser config, but `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is a build secret used for source maps and must stay out of client code. Keep Session Replay disabled in development so local testing does not consume replay quota.
- Preserve Upstash Redis rate limits on credentials login, register, forgot password, resend verification, checkout, support ticket creation, and AI menu description generation.

## Documentation Maintenance

- Treat docs updates as part of feature completion, not as optional cleanup after the code works.
- Update documentation in the same branch/PR when a change adds or changes routes, role behavior, environment variables, database fields/models, third-party integrations, background jobs, order/payment/email/courier/auth logic, realtime behavior, observability, test commands, or user-facing workflows.
- Use the smallest useful docs change. Avoid repeating implementation details everywhere; put product behavior in `DESCRIPTION.md`, system/data-flow details in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, setup and package/env guidance in `README.md`, and test workflow changes in `TESTING.md`, `__tests__/README.md`, or `e2e/README.md`.
- Keep AI guidance synchronized across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/project-instructions.md`, `.gemini/project-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`, and `.windsurf/rules/project-conventions.md` when changing workflow-critical rules.
- For every meaningful code/docs change that will become a commit, add the commit title/name to `documentation.txt` so the project work log stays aligned with the git history.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the final merge checklist for validation and documentation ownership.
- Do not add new AI-tool config folders unless the team actually uses that tool. Prefer maintaining the existing small set of AI instruction files.
- In the final response for non-trivial changes, mention whether docs were updated or why no docs change was needed.

## AI Configuration Folders

- `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` contains Cursor auto-applied rules.
- `.claude/project-instructions.md` contains supplemental Claude workflow guidance.
- `.windsurf/rules/project-conventions.md` contains Windsurf project rules.
- `.gemini/project-instructions.md` contains supplemental Gemini workflow guidance.
- Root files remain canonical for shared project policy: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`.
- Keep these files consistent when changing auth, payments, email, courier, env vars, or docs policy.

## Common Commands

- npm run dev
- npm run build
- npm run start
- npm run lint
- npm run test
- npm run test:watch
- npm run test:file -- **tests**/api/register.route.test.ts
- npm run test:auth
- npm run test:profile
- npm run test:qstash

- npm run test:e2e:profile
- npm run test:all
- npm run favorites:backfill
- npm run stripe:listen
- npm run stripe:trigger

## Testing Conventions

- Test runner: Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`).
- Test root folders: `__tests__/`, `mocks/`, and `e2e/`.
- Start with high-risk logic (auth, payments, webhooks, role checks).
- Keep runtime code unchanged unless explicitly requested; prefer tests-only changes.
- For auth tests, cover both success and failure behavior contracts.
- For profile tests, cover info updates, image upload/remove, and account deletion flows.
- For order-flow tests, cover checkout validation, best coupon suggestion, reorder validation, restaurant availability, notification copy, courier summaries, and delivery status transitions.
- For date-format changes, cover `libs/dateFormat.ts` and any business logic that depends on weekday/date calculations.
- Use `__tests__/utils/testFactories.ts` for generated fixtures, and prefer `__tests__/utils/mongoMemoryServer.ts` when a Mongo integration test needs full database isolation.
- Use `MONGODB_URL_TESTS` for local test database configuration when needed.
- Keep e2e tests data-safe with explicit cleanup of created records.

## When Modifying Auth, Payments, Email, or Courier Logic

- Confirm required env vars are present (`NEXTAUTH_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `RESEND_*`, Cloudinary values, optional `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` values, and optional `QSTASH_*` values when delayed jobs are touched).
- Keep Stripe webhook handling idempotent.
- Do not expose server secrets in client bundles.
- Preserve courier location validation and role checks.

## Quality Checklist

- Lint passes: npm run lint
- No secrets in source control
- Update README.md (and, if needed, documentation.txt) when adding major features or env vars
